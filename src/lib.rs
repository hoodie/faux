//! # Faux
//!
//! A library to create [mocks] out of `struct`s.
//!
//! `faux` provides macros to help you create mocks out of your
//! structs without the need of generics/trait objects polluting your
//! function signatures.
//!
//! **`faux` makes liberal use of unsafe rust features, and it is only
//! recommended for use inside tests.**
//!
//! [mocks]: https://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html
//!
//! ## Usage:
//! ```
//! // creates the mockable struct
//! #[cfg_attr(test, faux::create)]
//! # #[faux::create]
//! pub struct Foo {
//!     a: u32,
//! }
//!
//! // mocks the methods
//! #[cfg_attr(test, faux::methods)]
//! # #[faux::methods]
//! impl Foo {
//!     pub fn new(a: u32) -> Self {
//!         Foo { a }
//!     }
//!
//!     pub fn add_stuff(&self, input: u32) -> u32 {
//!         self.a + input
//!     }
//!
//!     pub fn add_ref(&self, input: &u32) -> u32 {
//!         self.a + *input
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! #[cfg(test)]
//! #[test]
//! fn test() {
//!   // you can create the original object
//!   let real = Foo::new(3);
//!   assert_eq!(real.add_stuff(2), 5);
//!
//!   // can create a mock using the auto-generated `faux` method
//!   let mut mock = Foo::faux();
//!
//!   // if the inputs and output for a method are all static types
//!   // then it can be mocked safely
//!   faux::when!(mock.add_stuff).safe_then(|x| x);
//!   assert_eq!(mock.add_stuff(5), 5);
//!
//!   // other methods can be mocked using unsafe
//!   unsafe { faux::when!(mock.add_ref).then(|&x| x + 1) }
//!   assert_eq!(mock.add_ref(&3), 4);
//! }
//! #
//! # fn main() {
//! #    // you can create the original object
//! #    let real = Foo::new(3);
//! #    assert_eq!(real.add_stuff(2), 5);
//! #
//! #    // can create a mock using the auto-generated `faux` method
//! #    let mut mock = Foo::faux();
//! #
//! #    // if the inputs and output for a method are all static types
//! #    // then it can be mocked safely
//! #    faux::when!(mock.add_stuff).safe_then(|x| x);
//! #    assert_eq!(mock.add_stuff(5), 5);
//! #
//! #    // other methods can be mocked using unsafe
//! #    unsafe { faux::when!(mock.add_ref).then(|&x| x + 1) }
//! #    assert_eq!(mock.add_ref(&3), 4);
//! #  }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Features:
//! * Mock async methods
//! * Mock trait implementations
//! * Mock generic structs
//! * Mock methods with arbitrary self types (e.g., `self: Rc<Self>`). **limited support**
//! * Mock methods from structs in a different module

/// Transforms the given struct into a mockable version of itself.
///
/// It creates an associated function for the tagged struct called
/// `faux` and masks the original definition of the struct by changing
/// its name.
///
/// Use [cargo-expand] to see what your struct expands to after the
/// macro.
///
/// # Requirements
///
/// This macro deliberately fails to compile if any of the struct's
/// fields are not private. Otherwise, a user of the struct could try
/// to access the field directly when it no longer exists in the
/// transformed version.
///
/// The transformed struct is useless unless its methods are also
/// mocked. See [#\[methods\]] for documentation on how to mock the
/// methods of the struct. If `#[methods]` is not used for an impl
/// block, methods inside the impl may not use any of its fields.
///
/// # Usage
/// ```
/// #[faux::create]
/// pub struct MyStruct {
///     a: i32,
///     b: Vec<u32>,
/// }
///
/// #[faux::methods]
/// impl MyStruct {
///     /* methods go here */
/// }
///
/// # fn main() {
/// // creates a mock out of MyStruct
/// let my_mock = MyStruct::faux();
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// # Attribute arguments
///
/// ## self_type
///
/// Allowed values:
/// * `#[methods(self_type = "Rc")]`
/// * `#[methods(self_type = "Arc")]`
/// * `#[methods(self_type = "Box")]`
/// * `#[methods(self_type = "Owned")]`
///   * this is the default and not necessary
///
/// This argument tells faux that instead of holding a real value of your
/// struct (when the struct is not being mocked), to hold your struct
/// wrapped in the specified `self_type`. Faux should guide you
/// towards using this argument through either a compile error or a
/// panic in your tests.
///
/// This argument is helpful when you want your struct to *ONLY* be
/// publicly viewed through one of these wrappers (i.e., your
/// functions to create your struct returns an Rc<Self>). Iff a
/// `self_type` is specified here, then it must also be specified in
/// all of the impl blocks tagged with [#\[methods\]]. The author's
/// recommendation is to only use this feature when faux suggests you
/// to.
///
/// # Usage
/// ```
/// use std::sync::Arc;
///
/// #[faux::create(self_type = "Arc")]
/// pub struct MyStruct {
///     /* private fields */
/// }
///
/// #[faux::methods(self_type = "Arc")]
/// impl MyStruct {
///     pub fn new() -> Arc<Self> {
///         /* implementation */
///         # Arc::new(MyStruct {})
///     }
///
///     /* more methods */

pub use faux_macros::create;

/// Transforms the given methods into mockable versions of themselves
/// and provides a new method to mock them.
///
/// The generated methods look like
///
/// ```ignore
/// impl MyStruct {

///
///     // I is a tuple of all the non-receiver arguments of #{method_name}
///     // O is the output of #{method_name}
///     _when_#{method_name}(&mut self) -> When<I,O> {
///         /* auto generated code */
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// These auto-generated methods can be called directly but a more
/// ergonomic way is by using [when!].
///
/// Associated functions and private methods are not mocked, and are
/// instead proxied to the real implementation.
///
/// # Requirements
///
/// [#\[create\]] must have been previously called for this struct.

/// // unsafe because a parameter is a reference. See When's documentation
/// unsafe { faux::when!(fake.read).then(|a| Ok(a[0] as usize)) }
/// assert_eq!(fake.read(&mut vec![10]).unwrap(), 10);
/// # }
/// ```
/// # Attribute arguments
///
/// There are times when faux needs a little extra information to
/// properly mock your struct and its methods. Use `path =
/// "path::to::imported::mod"` when you are mocking methods from a
/// struct imported from a different module. Use `self_type =
/// "{self_type}"` when your method receivers would not allow faux to
/// get an owned value from it, this is particularly important for
/// `self: Rc<Self>` and `self: Arc<Self>` receivers.
///
/// ## path
///
/// Faux supports mocking structs from a different module as long as
/// we tell `#[methods]` where we are importing the struct from.
///
/// ```
/// mod foo {
///     #[faux::create]
///     pub struct MyStruct {}
///
///     // no need to tell #[faux::methods] where to find `MyStruct`
///     // if defined in the same module
///     #[faux::methods]
///     impl MyStruct {
///         pub fn three(&self) -> i32 {
///             3
///         }
///     }
///
///     mod foo_inner {
///         // the type is being imported from somewhere else
///         use super::MyStruct;
///
///         // so we have to tell faux where it came from
///         #[faux::methods(path = "super")]
///         impl MyStruct {
///             pub fn four(&self) -> i32 {
///                 self.three() + 1
///             }
///         }
///     }
/// }
///
/// mod bar {
///     // we are importing a module from somewhere else
///     use crate::foo;
///
///     // so we need to tell faux where that module came from
///     #[faux::methods(path = "crate")]
///     impl foo::MyStruct {
///         pub fn five(&self) -> i32 {
///             self.three() + 2
///         }
///     }
/// }
///
/// # fn main() {
/// let mut x = foo::MyStruct::faux();
/// faux::when!(x.three).safe_then(|_| 30);
/// faux::when!(x.four).safe_then(|_| 40);
/// faux::when!(x.five).safe_then(|_| 50);
///
/// assert_eq!(x.three(), 30);
/// assert_eq!(x.four(), 40);
/// assert_eq!(x.five(), 50);
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// ## self_type
///
/// Allowed values:
/// * `#[methods(self_type = "Rc")]`
/// * `#[methods(self_type = "Arc")]`
/// * `#[methods(self_type = "Box")]`
/// * `#[methods(self_type = "Owned")]`
///   * this is the default and not necessary
///
/// The `self_type` specified in methods *must* match the [self_type
/// in `create`](attr.create.html#self_type) and is required iff one
/// was specified there.
///
/// The method receivers for all the methods in the impl block must be
/// convertable from the `self_type` specified. In particular, while a
/// `&self` can be obtained from an `Rc<Self>` or an `Arc<Self>`, a
/// `&mut self` cannot. This means that if you specify `self_type =
/// "Rc"`, then none of the methods being mocked may take a `&mut
/// self` as a receiver. If you believe that a certain combination of
/// specified `self_type` and method receiver is doable but now
/// allowed in `faux` please file an issue.
///
/// Another effect of specifying the `self_type` is gaining the
/// ability to include methods and associated functions that return
/// `Self` wrapped in that pointer type.
///
/// ```
/// use std::rc::Rc;
///
/// #[faux::create(self_type = "Rc")]
/// pub struct ByRc {}
///
/// #[faux::methods(self_type = "Rc")]
/// impl ByRc {
///     // you can still return plain Self
///     pub fn new() -> Self {
///         ByRc {}
///     }
///
///     // but you may also now return the self wrapped in the self_type
///     pub fn new_rc() -> Rc<Self> {
///         Rc::new(ByRc {})
///     }
///
///     // can call methods with an Rc<Self> receiver type
///     pub fn by_rc(self: Rc<Self>) {}
///
///     // Rc<Self> derefs to &self so this is okay
///     pub fn by_ref(&self) {}
/// }
/// # fn main() {}
/// ```
///
/// # Panics
///
/// ## Non-mocked methods
///
/// Faux will not try to return a default value on non-mocked methods
/// so it panics instead.
///
/// ```should_panic
/// #[faux::create]
/// pub struct MyStruct {}
///
/// #[faux::methods]
/// impl MyStruct {
///     pub fn get(&self) -> usize {
///         50
///     }
/// }
///
/// # fn main() {
/// let fake = MyStruct::faux();
/// // when!(fake.get).then_safe() was not invoked and thus the method was not mocked
/// fake.get(); // <~ panics with "'MyStruct::get' is not mocked"
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// ## Mocking real instances
///
/// Spies are not supported and thus mocking real instances panic.
///
/// ```should_panic
/// #[faux::create]
/// pub struct MyStruct {}
///
/// #[faux::methods]
/// impl MyStruct {
///     pub fn new() -> MyStruct {
///         MyStruct {}
///     }
///
///     pub fn get(&self) -> usize {
///         50
///     }
/// }
///
/// # fn main() {
/// let mut fake = MyStruct::new();
/// faux::when!(fake.get); // <~ panics with "not allowed to mock a real instance!"
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// ## Structs with `self: Rc<Self>` or `self: Arc<Self>` methods that have been cloned
///
/// While you do not need to specify `#[self_type = "Rc"]` or
/// `#[self_type = "Arc"]` even if you have `self: Rc<Self>` or `self:
/// Arc<Self>` receivers respectively, the real instances that are
/// created through this *must* be the only reference to the object
/// when calling these methods or else your test will fail.
///
/// ```rust should_panic
/// use std::rc::Rc;
///
/// #[faux::create]
/// pub struct Owned { /* fields */ }
///
/// #[faux::methods]
/// impl Owned {
///    pub fn new() -> Owned {
///        /* implementation */
///        # Owned {}
///    }
///
///    pub fn by_rc(self: Rc<Self>) {
///        /* implementation */
///    }
/// }
///
/// # pub fn main() {
/// // works if there is only a single reference
/// let rcd = Rc::new(Owned::new());
/// rcd.by_rc(); // this works
///
/// // panics if there are multiple references
/// let rcd = Rc::new(Owned::new());
/// let clone = rcd.clone();
/// rcd.by_rc(); // this panics because there are now multiple references
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// In the case of a panic the panic message faux produces should
/// guide you towards using the `self_type` argument in the faux
/// attributes
///
/// # Known Limitations
///
/// [#13]: Only a single inherent impl block and a single trait
/// implementation per trait per type may exist.
///
/// [#14]: Methods may not contain instances of the same struct as parameters.

/// # Caveats
///
/// ## Methods/functions that return the mocked struct
///
/// Special care is taken for methods and function that return an
/// instance of the mocked struct. Unfortunately only methods that
/// return `-> Self` or `-> #{SomeStruct}` are
/// handled.
///
/// Methods/functions that returns your type wrapped as a generic of
/// another type (e.g., `Result<Self, _>`) cannot be wrapped in a faux
/// impl.  The exception to this is methods that receive an specified
/// [self_type](#self_type).

///     pub fn try_to_new() -> Result<Self, String> {
///         Ok(MyStruct {})
///     }
/// }
///
/// # fn main() {}
/// ```
///
/// A workaround is to place these functions outside the impl tagged
/// with `#[faux::method]` and have it redirect to the method inside the
/// tagged impl
///
/// ```
/// #[faux::create]
/// pub struct MyStruct {}
///
/// #[faux::methods]
/// impl MyStruct {
///     fn new() -> Self {

///     }
/// }
///
/// # fn main() {
/// let x = MyStruct::try_to_new();
/// assert!(x.is_ok());
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// ## Paths in types
///
/// `faux` supports implementing types of the form `path::to::Type` as
/// long as the path does not contain any `super` or `crate`
/// keywords. To implement such types use the [`path`](#path)
/// argument.
